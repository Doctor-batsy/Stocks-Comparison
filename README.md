# Tech Stocks Analysis 2023

This project compares the 2023 stock prices of Google, Apple, and Tesla.

## Using Yahoo Finance Data
We use data from the S&P 500, which includes the top 500 US companies leading in finance. Our daily study helps us accurately analyze and compare stocks. We look at things like how much the stocks earn and how risky they are.

First, we check the cumulative returns, which show how much the stock value changes over time. This helps us see which stock did better or worse in 2023.

Next, we look at volatility by finding out how much the stock prices go up and down each day. This tells us how risky the stocks are. We found that Tesla's stock changes more than Google's and Apple's, meaning it's riskier. While Google's stock also moves quite a bit, it's less risky than Tesla's. This might be because Tesla's stock is more affected by market changes and news.

So, if you're okay with risk and want to make quick profits, Tesla's stock might be interesting for you. But if you prefer less risk, you might lean towards Google or Apple.

Next, we're looking at how Google, Apple, and Tesla stocks compare to the S&P 500, a major US stock market index. This index includes 500 big companies and gives us a good idea of how the stock market is doing. By looking at "beta" values, we can tell how risky or bouncy these stocks are compared to the market.

For Apple, the beta is about 1.1232. This means Apple's stock moves about 12.32% more than the market. If the market goes up or down, Apple's stock might go up or down even more. Google's beta is around 1.4295, so it's about 42.95% more up and down than the market, finaly for Tesla, the beta is approximately 2.2650. This indicates that Tesla's stock tends to move about 126.50% more than the overall market.

A beta more than 1 means the stock is more wiggly than the overall market. Here, all stocks have betas over 1, showing they're likely to be more bouncy with market changes.

For our concluding analysis, we'll visually represent the relationship between our selected stocks by plotting a linear regression to showcase their correlation.
